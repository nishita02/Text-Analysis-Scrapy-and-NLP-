Title: ['Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on office space and co-working industries.']
Description: COVID 19 has bought the world to its knees. With businesses being shut, travel being banned, schools, and colleges being closed, we have observed an impeccable amount of sorrow and despise along with a great amount of mental torture and destruction.
