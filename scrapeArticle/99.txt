Title: ['Estimating the impact of COVID-19 on the world of work']
Description: COVID-19 an unprecedented pandemic for us but a “Can-be” possibility for great leaders such as bill gates came into action since the rising of the year 2020. The corollary of this pandemic is so prodigious that the analysis by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) stated that the COVID-19 pandemic is disrupting global supply chains and international trade which in turn could shrink the global economy by up to 1 percent in 2020, a reversal from the previous forecast of 2.5 percent growth. More than 6.6 million Americans filed unemployment claims and the economic downturn is expected to be the worst recession since the Great Depression as stated by the IMF. India is facing its biggest crisis in decades, with a three-week lockdown initially, but extending further in a nation of 1.3 billion people likely to result in an economic recession, millions of job losses and possible starvation among the poor. It can be said that economic contagion is now spreading as fast as the disease itself. On the contrary nature has pressed the reset button, the environment is having a noticeable benefit from this scenario. Water is getting clearer, the air is turning breathable and various such news and pictures can be easily heard and seen on newspapers, telly, and social media platforms on day to day basis. But this is the storyline of the present, what about the future? Are the predictions made by financial institutions and thought leaders going to be true? Or something unexpected is going to happen that will make us think of our human capabilities again?
