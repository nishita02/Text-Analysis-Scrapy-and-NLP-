their presence in Indian lands; They recognized the benefits of British rule. What
was the factor that made Indians accept the
British government? The perception about
British-policies (about trading, pay-scale, and positioning in the military) had been
done through various marketing channels in such a way that it brainwashed people of the nation, and many were ready to accept the British. So the Marketing is like fire when smartly
handled; it can destroy your enemies, but when not it can burn you.
